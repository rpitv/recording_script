This script encapsulates the various recording tasks we run on the recording
computer. It can be run as either "record" or "stream".

In record mode, it takes a production name, as well as some flags to override
the defaults. By default, recording is from card 0 to a HD M-JPEG .mov file
with 8-channel audio. Other presets available include sd_mjpeg and sd_mpeg,
which may be useful when recording an isolated camera for burning to disc.

In stream mode, no additional arguments are required. By default the script
will stream from card 1 to rtmp://video1.rpitv.org/rpitv-live/rpitv-live at
2000kbps. A URL can be provided on the command line to stream to a different
location. Bitrate can be changed with '-r 4000k', for example. A bug can be
overlaid by using '-b' or '-B /path/to/bug.svg'. Currently there is only one
preset for streaming - h264_1080, which streams a deinterlaced 1080p feed.

The "monitor" script looks for running "avpinput_decklink" processes, then
displays the preview audio and (low-res) video in the terminal. To display
video in the terminal, the "viu" program needs to be installed.
